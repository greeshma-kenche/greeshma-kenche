## 💫 About Me

Hi, I'm Greeshma Kenche — a final-year Computer Science student currently diving deep into JavaScript and the MERN stack. I’m working on building real-world projects to strengthen my web development skills and get more confident with full-stack development.

Previously, I worked as a Full Stack Developer at OpenText, where I gained experience using Java and other backend technologies. Now, I'm focused on expanding my skills on the JavaScript side while also learning Data Structures and Algorithms to become a stronger problem-solver.

I’m still early in my journey of creating personal projects, but I’m actively learning, experimenting, and building — one step at a time. 💻
