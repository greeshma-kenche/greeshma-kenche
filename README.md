## 💫 About Me

Hi! I'm Greeshma — a final-year Computer Science student, aspiring to become a creative and skilled software developer. I enjoy turning complex problems into simple, beautiful, and intuitive designs. My focus right now is building interactive, responsive websites and continuously sharpening my skills across the full stack.

- 🎓 **Graduating in May 2025**
- 🌱 Learning: React, Tailwind CSS, and modern JavaScript
- 🔍 Exploring: UI animations, responsive design, and debugging techniques
- 💬 Always curious and constantly growing — one project at a time
